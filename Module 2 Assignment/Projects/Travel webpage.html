                <p class="net">Mombasa is Kenya's main tourist destination. It is on the eastern coastline of Kenya,<br> bordering the Indian Ocean which has made it a popular destination for its beaches.<br> Mombasa offers a diverse marine life, world-class hotels and friendly atmosphere.<br> There is a tropical climate all year and it is a great destination filled with activities for all ages.<br>

                 <h2>History</h2> 
                 <p class="net">The first urban area was founded near what today is known as <em>Old Town</em> around 900 AD<br>by a man named <strong>Sheheh Mvita</strong>. Its strategic position along the maritime route to India<br> caused the city to be coveted by many powers, and it was a notable port for the ivory<br> and spice trades.
                    Several travellers and explorers passed through the region<br> starting no later than the 1st century, but the first written record of the city was by the <strong>Moroccan Ibn Battuta</strong> in 1330.</p>
